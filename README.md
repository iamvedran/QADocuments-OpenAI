# QADocuments-OpenAI

This is a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to use the langchain javascript library to perform retrieval-based question answering on a text document. 

The code snippet assumes that you have installed the langchain library and its dependencies, and that you have an API key for accessing the OpenAI language model.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run:

```sh
npm install -S langchain
```

Accessing their API requires an API key. Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running in powershell:
```sh
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="MY_API_KEY"
```

## Usage

To use this code snippet, follow these steps:
```sh
npm start
```
